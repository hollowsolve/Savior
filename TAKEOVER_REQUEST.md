**Reasons for the request**
## Justification
The 'savior' package has been abandoned for 6 years (last update: Sept 6, 2019). 
The package description still states: 
- "Currently in development and not stable yet" (As of September 6, 2019)
- "You probably shouldn't use it to store important data."
After 6 years, this project is clearly not in active development. The package name 'savior' is perfect for my production-ready backup tool that actually saves developers' work.
Given the extreme length of abandonment (6 years) and the fact the package itself warns people not to use it, I believe transferring the name would benefit the Python community.
## My Project
**Repository**: https://github.com/hollowsolve/Savior
**Current Status**: Ready for release
**Description**: Automatic backup tool that saves developers' work
**Features:** Multi-project support, file compression, emergency tools, and much more
**Evidence of active development**:
- Fully functional codebase with CLI
- Smart incremental backups
- Live status monitoring
- Auto-cleanup of old backups
- Comprehensive README with documentation
- 3000+ lines of code across multiple modules
**Why this name matters**:
The name 'savior' perfectly describes what my tool does - it saves developers from losing work. Having the exact package name would help developers find and install it easily with `pip install savior`.
**Community benefit**:
Unlike the abandoned package that warns "don't use for important data", my Savior is production-ready and actively maintained. It would provide actual value to developers who need seamless, efficient backups - without the overhead of using git.

**Contact and additional research**
Contact request to the owner was sent on Sep 17, 2025.

Given the package has been inactive for 6 years (since September 2019), and has never been stable across any version, allowing the current implementation to exist at this point would be an enormous waste of efficiency that developers desperately need.

I'm ready to provide an open source, actively maintained, production-ready tool that actually helps developers with the 'savior' name.
