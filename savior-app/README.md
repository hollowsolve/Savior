# Savior Desktop App ðŸ›Ÿ

A beautiful, native desktop application for Savior that seamlessly integrates with the CLI version.

## Features

- **Visual Dashboard**: See all your projects and their backup status at a glance
- **Real-time Monitoring**: Live updates when backups are created
- **Backup Timeline**: Browse and restore from any backup with a click
- **Settings Panel**: Configure backup preferences through an intuitive UI
- **System Tray Integration**: Runs quietly in the background
- **Cross-platform**: Works on macOS, Windows, and Linux
- **CLI Compatibility**: Works seamlessly with existing Savior CLI installations

## Architecture

The app uses a hybrid architecture:
- **Electron + React + TypeScript**: Modern, responsive UI
- **Python Bridge**: Direct integration with existing Savior Python code
- **IPC Communication**: Real-time updates between processes
- **Shared Configuration**: Uses same `~/.savior/` directory as CLI
